This folder contains the Jupyter notebooks for this project using the datasets in the [assets](./../assets/) and [artifacts](./../artifacts/) folders.

## Bad Example of Jupyter notebook and code
This Jupyter notebook is an example of what not to do.  
- [Notebook 1-01: EDA and Data Visualization of the population (1950 - 2021)](notebook-1-01-example-bad-code-population.ipynb)  

## Corrected Example of Jupyter notebook and code
These Jupyter notebooks take [Notebook 1-01](notebook-1-01-example-bad-code-population.ipynb) and show a corrected better example of how to layout and code a Jupyter notebook
- [Notebook 2-01: EDA of the population (1950 - 2021)](notebook-2-01-example-better-code-population-eda.ipynb)  
- [Notebook 2-02: Data Visualization of the Population Pyramid](notebook-2-02-example-better-code-population-dv.ipynb)
