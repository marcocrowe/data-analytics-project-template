# Assessment Criteria

> "Why don’t people look up and move ahead? The answer is, well, you start formulating an ideal, and you formulate a judge. It’s pretty easy to feel intimidated in the face of your own ideal. That’s what happens to Cain versus Abel, for example. Then it’s really easy to destroy the ideal instead of trying to pursue it, because then you get rid of the judge." - [Dr Jordan B Peterson, 2017](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/transcripts/biblical-series-xi/)
