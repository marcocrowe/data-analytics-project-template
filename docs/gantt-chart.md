## Gantt Chart

>"Make a bad plan. Make the best one you can, but don't get obsessive about it. Make a plan, implement it. You'll figure out when you implement it why it's stupid, exactly, and then you can fix it a little bit, and then you can fix it a bit more, and then, eventually, you get a good plan, even if you start with something that's not the best." - [Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, 2018](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/transcripts/aubrey-marcus/)
