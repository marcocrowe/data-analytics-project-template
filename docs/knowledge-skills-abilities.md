## Reflections

> "You can only find out what you actually believe (rather than what you think you believe) by watching how you act. You simply donâ€™t know what you believe, before that. You are too complex to understand yourself." - [Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, 2018](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)

The known Knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSA) required to complete the project. Unfortunately we cannot know the unknown unknowns KSA's required to complete the project.  

## Exercises

> "Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today" - [Dr. Jordan B. Peterson, 2018](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/12-rules-for-life/)
