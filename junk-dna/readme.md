# Junk DNA
> "There were long stretches of DNA in between genes that didn't seem to be doing very much; some even referred to these as 'junk DNA', though a certain amount of hubris was required for anyone to call any part of the genome 'junk', given our level of ignorance." - Dr Francis Collins, 2008

This directory is for the code and artifacts built during development that didn't make it into the release of the project.
